# DjangoPerfTest

A simple Django project meant to demonstrate the scalability principles expounded upon by [Lincoln
Loop](https://lincolnloop.com/)'s *[High Performance Django](https://highperformancedjango.com/)*.

This project is currently under construction, but the plan is to ultimately include some data on performance
tests (as well as instructions on how to reproduce these tests on your own).
